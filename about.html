        <p>
            My name is Joshua Lonon, but friends and family call me Alex. I am a cybersecurity major at USC Upstate in Spartanburg, South Carolina. 
            I previously attended the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC, before I decided to leave school for a while to decide what I really wanted to do. 
            Initially I wanted to be a commercial pilot, but unfortunately was unable to pursue this. In the meantime, I worked in kitchens and later as a window washer in Spartanburg.
            I decided that I wanted to pursue something greater again, so I went back to school to pursue a degree in computer science. 
            I went to SCC first, before deciding to transfer to Upstate for cybersecurity. I have enjoyed learning about computers since I was young, when I first learned HTML5 and CSS
            from a library book. I also enjoy music production, kayaking, surfing, riding bikes, and playing video games.
